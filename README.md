# challenge-10

This project was made to be an SVG logo generator in the CLI.
I made this so if I need to create a simple logo I have the ability to without hiring a graphic designer.
I used Node.JS, Jest and Inquirer.

How to Use:
In the CLI, use the command npm i to download the package.json.
Once downloaded use the command node index.js to pull up the prompts.
create your anser for the prompts, once down the svg will be generated.
